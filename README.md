<h1>Visualizing Dynamical Systems of Polynomials Modulo <i>n</i> Using Matplotlib</h1>
<h2>Undergraduate Research Project with Jonathan Weisbrod</h2>

Upon running periodicList.py with Python3, you will be presented with:

![GUI](periodicListGUI.png)

The program will repeatedly apply the given function (starting at 5) until a period is found mod n, where it checks all n in the range of 1 to 1000.

Here is a sample plot with 'x^2-3' as the function and the line option left blank, where the x-axis represents n and y represents some value. A black dot at (x,y) means x is periodic mod y.

<h2>Plot of xÂ²-3</h2>

You may run the program with a given line where it will only plot the coordinate values along that line. Here I zoomed in on the plot given with 'x^2-3' as the function and '-1*x+481' as the line.
